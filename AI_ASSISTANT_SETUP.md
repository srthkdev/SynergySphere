## Technical Details

- **Model**: GPT-4o-mini (cost-effective and fast)
- **Framework**: LangChain + LangGraph for AI orchestration and tool calling
- **Database Integration**: **Text-to-SQL** - Natural language questions converted to SQL queries
- **Query Approach**: 
  - User asks natural language question
  - AI converts to safe PostgreSQL query
  - Executes query against database
  - Uses results as context for response
- **Safety**: Only SELECT statements allowed, with SQL injection protection
- **Flexibility**: Can answer ANY question about your data - not limited to pre-built queries
- **Streaming**: Real-time response streaming for better UX
- **Context**: Maintains conversation history and user context for personalized responses

## Cost Considerations

GPT-4o-mini is very cost-effective:
- Input: ~$0.15 per 1M tokens
- Output: ~$0.60 per 1M tokens

A typical conversation will cost fractions of a cent.

## Troubleshooting

### "OpenAI API key not configured" Error
- Ensure your `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in your environment variables
- Restart your development server after adding the API key

### No Response from AI
- Check your internet connection
- Verify your OpenAI API key is valid and has credits
- Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors

### Rate Limiting
- OpenAI has rate limits for API calls
- If you hit limits, wait a moment before trying again
- Consider upgrading your OpenAI plan for higher limits

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:
- Project context awareness (integrate with your actual projects)
- Task creation directly from AI suggestions
- Meeting notes summarization
- Custom project templates based on AI recommendations
- Integration with calendar for timeline planning
