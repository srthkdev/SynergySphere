The Challenge: "SynergySphere – Advanced Team
Collaboration Platform"
Overall Vision: SynergySphere is built on a simple idea: teams do their best work when their
tools truly support how they think, communicate, and move forward together. This platform aims
to go beyond traditional project management software by becoming an intelligent backbone for
teams — helping them stay organized, communicate better, manage resources more effectively,
and make informed decisions without friction.
At its core, SynergySphere is about helping teams operate at their best — continuously
improving, staying aligned, and working smarter every day.
Mission: Your challenge is to design and build a desktop and mobile-ready platform that acts
like a central nervous system for team collaboration. SynergySphere should not only
streamline the basics like tasks and communication but also work proactively — catching
potential issues early and helping teams stay ahead rather than constantly reacting.
This means creating a system that feels supportive, insightful, and seamless — something that
naturally fits into the rhythm of a working team.
Target User Pain Points Addressed: SynergySphere is designed to directly address common
and persistent pain points experienced by teams across various domains:
Teams everywhere deal with the same headaches. SynergySphere is here to solve the ones
that slow everyone down the most:
● Scattered Information: Important files, chats, and decisions live in too many places. It’s
hard to keep track of what’s where.
● Unclear Progress: Without visibility into tasks, it’s tough to know how far along a project
really is — or what’s holding it up.
● Resource Overload or Confusion: Assignments can get messy. Team members end
up overworked, underutilized, or unsure of what they’re supposed to do.
● Deadline Surprises: We often notice we're behind when it’s already too late.
SynergySphere should surface potential issues before they become real problems.
● Communication Gaps: Updates get missed. People get left out of the loop.
Conversations are buried in email or lost in scattered chats.
By addressing these pain points directly, SynergySphere positions itself as a platform that
doesn’t just organize — it orchestrates collaboration intelligently and proactively.
Round 1 (8 Hours): Laying the Foundation – Core
Collaboration MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
Problem Statement for Round 1: "Develop a foundational version of SynergySphere, focusing
on core task management and team communication. Teams must deliver a functional prototype,
accessible via both mobile and desktop interfaces, that allows users to create projects, add
team members, assign tasks with deadlines, track task status (e.g., To-Do, In Progress, Done),
and engage in project-specific threaded discussions. The system must employ efficient data
structures for managing project, user, and task data, ensuring a stable and responsive user
experience."
In this first round, you’ll develop a working MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for both mobile and
desktop platforms.
What it needs to do:
● Let users register/login
● Create and manage projects
● Add team members
● Assign tasks with due dates and statuses
● Communicate within each project
● Visualize task progress in a clear, intuitive way
● Send basic notifications for important events
Your prototype should be clean, responsive, and able to handle data efficiently — even at this
early stage.
Wireframes : Application (MVP)
The mobile application MVP for SynergySphere in Round 1 is designed for accessibility and
quick interactions, prioritizing core functionalities for users on the go. The user interface (UI)
must be intuitive and user-friendly, ensuring a smooth experience.
● Login/Sign Up Screen:
○ Description: Standard input fields for email and password for login. A link or
button for "Sign Up" leading to a registration form (email, password, perhaps
name). Option for "Forgot Password."
○ Elements: App logo, email input, password input, login button, sign-up
link/button, forgot password link.
● Project List/Dashboard Screen:
○ Description: Displays a list of all projects the logged-in user is a member of.
Each project entry should show the project name and perhaps a summary
statistic. A prominent "+" button or similar affordance to create a new project.
○ Elements: Header with app title/logo, list of projects (clickable items), new
project button.
● Project Detail View Screen:
○ Description: Accessed by tapping a project from the list. This screen is the hub
for a specific project. It should provide access to task lists/boards.
○ Task List/Board View Screen (within Project Detail):
○ Description: Displays tasks for the selected project. Can be a simple vertical list
of tasks or a basic card. Each task item should show title, assignee (perhaps an
avatar or initials), and due date. A "+" button to add a new task.
● Task Creation Modal/Screen:
○ Description: A form to create a new task. Fields for task title, description
(multi-line input), assignee (dropdown/searchable list of project members), and
due date (date picker). Buttons to "Save" or "Cancel."
○ Elements: Input fields for title, description, assignee, due date picker,
save/cancel buttons.
● Task Detail View Screen:
○ Description: Displays all details of a selected task. Shows title, description,
assignee, due date, current status. Allows editing of these fields (e.g., changing
status via a dropdown).
○ Elements: Task title, description, assignee, due date, status (editable), edit
button (optional, or fields directly editable).
● User Profile/Settings Screen (Basic):
○ Description: Accessible from a main navigation menu. Displays user's name
and email. Options for logging out. Potentially basic notification preferences
(on/off).
○ Elements: User name, email, logout button, basic settings toggles.
The mobile MVP wireframes must prioritize "on-the-go" use cases. This means that actions like
quickly checking assigned tasks, updating task statuses, receiving essential notifications, and
sending brief messages within a project context should be exceptionally smooth and require
minimal taps. The design should feel lightweight and responsive, enabling users to interact
efficiently while away from their primary workstation.
Even in its MVP stage, the desktop version of SynergySphere should begin to embody
"command center" aspects. It should provide users, especially project leads or managers, with a
broader overview of project activities and facilitate easier data entry for more complex tasks or
detailed descriptions.
All the UI must be mobile friendly.
